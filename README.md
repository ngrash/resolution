# resolution
An experimental analog experience I designed for the
[1GAM](https://www.onegameamonth.com/) game jam in January 2015 themed
"resolution".

## The Game (Here Be Spoilers)
```
As the rockets rise on new year's eve
you become clear that you have to change.

You want to clean up your room, eat healthy,
meet friends and become a better person.

You know what held you back last year.
You know what you have to do.
You want to ...

Step away from your computer.
```

Dependent on the difficulty you choose you are asked to step away from your
computer for 15 minutes (beginner), 1 hour (advanced) or 1 day (expert).

Using your mouse or pressing a key on your keyboard will suggest an activity
depending on the difficulty.

When the game looses focus or you press ESC you loose the game.
